By using MegaAntiCheat's demo-streaming features, you confirm your understanding of and consent to the following data collection procedures performed by the MegaAntiCheat client:

- Any demo recording that is started while the client-backend executable is running, whether started automatically or manually, will be livestreamed to a web server (the "Masterbase") under the control of megascatterbomb and certain members of the MegaAntiCheat development team ("We", "Us", "Our", etc).
    - These demo recordings may be used for research purposes, including but not limited to scanning the demo recording for potential cheaters.
    - We may publish your demo recordings, with or without modification, for the purposes of facilitating human review of the demo recording, and for substansiating the convictions of cheaters.
        - Modification of the demo may be required for certain facilities (e.g. anonymising the demo to prevent bias during human review).
    - Demo recordings include chat logs and recordings of the voice chat, potentially including your voice. We will never use this information for any purpose other than to ascertain whether cheating is occuring within the demo recording. We will never use this information to attempt to ascertain personally identifiable information about any individual.
        - To prevent your voice from being stored in the demo files, ensure the client convar "voice_loopback" is set to "0".
    - Demo recordings also retain information that you may otherwise expect to not be visible, including but not limited to the alias, weapons, and items you were using at the time of recording.
    - Demo recordings may be stored indefinitely, unless you exercise your right to forget.
- Players you have marked as "Cheater" or "Bot" will be reported to the Masterbase.
    - Reports of this nature will be transmitted when:
        - You mark a player as a "Cheater" or "Bot".
        - You encounter a player in-game that is presently marked by you as a "Cheater" or "Bot".
    - This data may be used for research purposes, including but not limited to use as training or validation data in machine learning for the purposes of cheat detection.
    - This data may be retained indefinitely, unless you exercise your right to forget.
- The Masterbase also produces network activity logs, which includes your IP address and other miscellanious information.
    - IP addresses and any other personally identifiable information will not be shared publicly under any circumstances.
    - This data is retained for up to one (1) week, with the possible exception of investigating cases of abuse.
- MegaAntiCheat uses your Steam API key to enable certain functionality within the program, including but not limited to downloading the profile pictures of Steam users.
    - We do not transmit or otherwise share your Steam API key to anyone, not even to MegaAntiCheat's own servers. Your Steam API key will not, and will never be, shared with anyone.
- All the data collected may be accessed by megascatterbomb or certain members of the MegaAntiCheat development team, and said data will be associated with your Steam account. Except as expressly stated herein, we will not share your data to any individuals outside of the MegaAntiCheat development team.
- You may withdraw your consent for these procedures at any time by un-checking the "Agree to TOS" checkbox within the MegaAntiCheat client.
- Your consent will be automatically withdrawn whenever these terms change, disabling the associated features until you reaffirm your consent under the new terms.
- The only official place to obtain the MegaAntiCheat client is at https://github.com/MegaAntiCheat/client-backend/releases. 
    - Clients obtained from other locations are not guaranteed to respect the terms stated here. We accept no liability for violations of these terms conducted by third party clients.
- We respect your right to forget. If you wish to have your demo recordings and other data erased, contact megascatterbomb via Discord (@megascatterbomb), or via email (megascatterbomb@gmail.com) explicitly stating your desire to have your data erased. We aim to comply with any requests within 30 days. To prevent malicious activity, you must include the last eight (8) characters of your valid API key in your request as proof of your identity.
    - We strongly recommend withdrawing your consent within the anticheat client prior to sending your request to prevent any additional data from being unwittingly collected.
- We are not affiliated with or endorsed by Valve Corporation or Steam.
